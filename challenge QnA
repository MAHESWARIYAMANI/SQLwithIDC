#DAY1 Challenge 
--List all unique hospital services available in the hospital.--
  SELECT DISTINCT(service) AS services 
  FROM services_weekly;
Explanation :
  When extracting data from a table people generally use select * from table_name which extracts everything (all rows & columns) from the table which takes much time to execute the query.
  If it is a small query/using a small dataset the execution time is negligible, but when it comes to large datasets it takes lot of time to load and execute the query.
  So the first and basic query optimisation technique is avoid using SELECT * table_name instead use SELECT column1, column2 from table_name.


#DAY2 Challenge
--Find all patients who are older than 60 years.
USE HOSPITAL;
SELECT patient_id,name FROM patients
WHERE age > 60;

--Retrieve all staff members who work in the 'Emergency' service.
SELECT staff_id, staff_name FROM staff
WHERE service = 'emergency';

--List all weeks where more than 100 patients requested admission in any service.
SELECT week,service FROM services_weekly
WHERE patients_request > 100;

/*Find all patients admitted to 'Surgery' service with a satisfaction score below 70,
showing their patient_id, name, age, and satisfaction score.*/
SELECT patient_id, name, age, satisfaction AS satisfaction_score 
FROM patients
WHERE service = 'surgery' AND satisfaction < 70;
